First TOP assignment "recipes"
Testing basic HTML and git skills

The project was pretty easy.
I did most of the stuff without issue.
Only issue I had was with resizing the image I put.
The problem was I put the "width" attribute before the "alt" and it seems that it doesn't work that way.
So I changed that and moved the "width" attribute to the end and now it seems to work fine.
